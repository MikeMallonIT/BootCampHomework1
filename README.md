# Homework 1 - Code Refractor - Michael Mallon

## What I did:
While working on this assignment I modified the HTML and CSS code so it complies with accessibility standards. The source code has been structured with semantic HTML elements with associated comments. It follows a logical structure with independent styling and positioning via CSS style sheet. Image elements have associated alt tags and all elements fall in sequential order.

### How to use it:
Download all associated files in this repository including the index.html file and all files in the assets folder. Style sheet is located in ../assets/css/style.css
