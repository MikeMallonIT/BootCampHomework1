# Homework 1 - Code Refractor - Michael Mallon

## What I did:
While working on this assignment I modified the HTML and CSS code so it complies with accessibility standards. To do so, the HTML code needed to be restructured into semantic elements: nav, sections with articles and aside. I also added alt descriptions for images for accessibility or in case they do not load (providing the user with a description of what the image would be). 

CSS styling sheet also needed to be condensed as several references were repetitive. Individual styling classes were created for elements that contained the exact same styling. Now, if multiple elements are styled the same way, they only reference one styling class. 

Comments in the HTML and CSS code were also added. This README.md file is part of the assignment as well

<br />

### Motivation:
During my undergrad degree, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. This Code Refractor assignment served as a refresher and reminded me how to code webpages while thinking about SEO and accessibility.

I also referenced websites such as: [Apple](https://apple.com), 
[PayPal](https://paypal.com), 
[Reddit](https://reddit.com) for advice on best practices for styling and elements.

<br />

### Why did I build this project:
I built this because the code that I started with did not meet any accessibility or SEO standards. I re-coded this website so other developers can easily read the code and contribute.

<br />

### Problems I solved:
    * Added Semantic Elements
    * Added Title/ Browser Tab Title
    * Deleted Footer
    * Condensed CSS
    * Added Alt Tags
